## Decision log

- Browser check driver: zero-dependency Chrome DevTools Protocol over node's native
  WebSocket (`tools/cdp.mjs`), not Playwright. Beat: Playwright/Puppeteer. Evidence:
  Chrome 152 and node 26 are present; the repo has no test framework and no runtime
  deps beyond Svelte/Vite, and a ~300MB browser download is not worth re-adding.
- Browser check drives the UI by the `aria-label`s already in the markup, not new
  `data-*` hooks. Evidence: `+page.svelte` is slated for splitting; instrumenting
  6,456 lines now would be redone. aria-labels are a stable contract.
- Readiness gate is the presence of the portrait model selectors plus the absence of
  "Connecting…", not the `<h1>`. Evidence: the shell is server-rendered, so `<h1>`
  exists before hydration; driving in that window silently no-ops (observed:
  `selectByText` and `clickText` both returned false against a live build).
- Served build base path is `/mullet`, baked in at build time and absent from the
  launchd plist. Evidence: `GET /` 404s, `GET /mullet/` 200s on 127.0.0.1:8781.

## Open defects found by the browser check, not yet worked

- M3 (scene still): UI renders "MiniMax H3 keeper still is unavailable. Refresh models"
  while `GET /mullet/api/portrait` reports `minimax-h3-ref2va-portrait-still-v1`
  `available=true missing=[]` and every required node exists on firestorm:8188.
  `inlineSceneSelectedModelAvailable` is a false negative at `+page.svelte:5833`.
- M1 (expression still): with a scenario loaded, `Portrait image model` reads
  "Z-Image Turbo", not the intended H3 default.
- M2/M4 (video): `src/lib/mp4.ts:519` rejects real ComfyUI H3 output in production with
  "MP4 video duration disagrees with its sample table" (exact equality between the
  container duration and the summed sample table). Observed live in
  `scratch/mullet.stderr.log` for both `portrait-video` and `inline-scene video`.
